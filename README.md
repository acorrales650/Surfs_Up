## Purpose and Overview
Is a surf shop in Oahu sustainable all year round? The best way to find out is by comparing the weather statistics in both months. By running one query for the month of June and one query for the month of December, we were able to extract the weather data from each month. From there, we stored the temperature data in a list and then converted the data to dataframes. A quick use of the describe command summaried the statistics of each for us. 

## Results
- The June temperature query resulted in 1700 records and the December query resulted in 1,517 records. 
- June finished with a maximum temperature of 85 and a minimum temperature of 64 degrees which concludes to a mean temperature of 75. 
- December finished with a maximum temperature of 83 and a minimum temperature of 56 degrees resulting in a mean temperature of 71.

## Analysis
The queries that were run resulted in a lot of useful information to support the theory that a surf shop in Oahu would prove to be a prosperous venture. Even in the perceived coldest month of the year, December, temperatures do not even fall below 56 and still maintain an average temperature in the 70s. Additionally, the standard deviation between the months of June and December was .5. 
- It might prove beneficial to find out other weather conditions besides the temperatures. For example, as stated above, the minimum temperature in December is 53 degrees. That could provide a potential debate as to whether a surf shop would be properous in that month. However, 53 degrees with all sun and no wind could still prove to be perfect conditions. 
- Additionally, another piece of data that could help with this question could be the possible conditions of the precipitation that those months experience. Often, in tropical climates like Oahu, they could experience severe bouts of rain and storms even when the temperatures are high. So, temperature degrees may not be completely substantianting the argument.
